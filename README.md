Optimal Traffic Route Prediction - ML Project

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning-based system for predicting optimal traffic routes. By leveraging advanced algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest, the project analyzes historical traffic data, real-time updates, and environmental factors to provide:

- Accurate route predictions
- Reduced travel time and congestion
- Personalized and eco-friendly recommendations

Built using Python, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in revolutionizing urban mobility.
